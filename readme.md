Edel Barcenas

This mod takes inspiration from the Elder Scrolls games. Its goal is to replicate their questing experience as well as their fantasy weapons.

How to Play: 
DON'T SHOOT! Not all characters are enemies. There are npc's standing around the map that you can talk to. When you find them, get close and press "t" to talk to them.
